            <p class="intro-para">
                Building a website isn't just about making it look good—it's about ensuring that everyone can 
                use it, regardless of their abilities or circumstances. As I continued my journey in web development, 
                I learned how to create websites that are accessible to a wide range of users, including those with 
                visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments.

            <h3 class="content-title">What I Learned About Web Accessibility</h3>
            <p class="content-para">
                Web accessibility is about removing barriers and ensuring that websites are easy to navigate and interact with for all users. 
                Some key principles I learned include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Semantic HTML</strong> - Using the right elements (&lt;nav&gt;, &lt;button&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, etc.) to improve screen reader support.</li>
                <li><strong>Keyboard Navigation</strong> - Ensuring users can interact with my site without a mouse.</li>
                <li><strong>ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) Attributes</strong> - Enhancing dynamic content for screen readers.</li>
                <li><strong>Colour Contrast & Readability</strong> - Choosing accessible colour schemes and ensuring text is easy to read.</li>
                <li><strong>Alt Text for Images</strong> - Describing images so visually impaired users understand their content.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="content-title">Making My Websites More Accessible</h3>
            <p class="content-para">
                To apply what I learned, I implemented several accessibility improvements in my projects, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Using Semantic HTML</strong> - Replacing generic &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; elements with proper HTML elements like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;.</li>
                <li><strong>Ensuring Keyboard Accessibility</strong> - Testing my websites using only the <strong>Tab</strong> key to navigate interactive elements.</li>
                <li><strong>Adding ARIA Labels</strong> - Using ARIA attributes (aria-label, aria-expanded, role, etc.) for dynamic elements like toggles and dropdowns.</li>
                <li><strong>Improving Colour Contrast</strong> - Using contrast-checking tools to ensure text and background colours met <strong>WCAG guidelines</strong> for readability.</li>
                <li><strong>Writing Descriptive Alt Text</strong> - Adding meaningful <strong>alt text</strong> to all images to assist screen reader users.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="content-title">Why Accessibility Matters</h3>
            <p class="content-para">
                By making my websites more accessible, I've improved <strong>usability for all users</strong>, not just those with disabilities. Accessibility benefits:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>People with disabilities</strong> - Screen readers, keyboard users, and those with visual impairments can navigate my sites easily.</li>
                <li><strong>Older users</strong> - Better readability and larger interactive elements help those with reduced vision or motor control.</li>
                <li><strong>Mobile users</strong> - Accessibility improvements also enhance usability on small screens and touch interfaces.</li>
                <li><strong>SEO (Search Engine Optimisation)</strong> - Search engines favour accessible, well-structured content.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="content-title">Next Steps</h3>
            <p class="content-para">
                Now that I understand the fundamentals of accessible development, I plan to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Learn <strong>more advanced ARIA</strong> techniques for improving complex interactions.</li>
                <li>Dive deeper into <strong>accessible forms</strong> and validation.</li>
                <li>Ensure my future projects meet the guideline for accessibility compliance.</li>
            </ul>

                    <p class="blog-text text-multi-line">Responsive design is all about making websites look and work great on any screen size. Whether someone is on a phone, 
                        tablet, or desktop, I want my sites to feel seamless. Learning responsive techniques helped me stop designing for 
                        just one layout—and start designing for real people using real devices.</p>

                    <p class="blog-text text-multi-line">CSS is what brings structure and design together. It’s not just about making things look good—it’s about 
                        creating layouts that adapt, interact, and behave the way users expect. As I developed more complex sites, 
                        I realised that understanding the core concepts of CSS was key to building reliable, responsive, and 
                        maintainable designs.</p>
