                There comes a point when you realise that something has to change. For me, that 
                moment hit hard—I was sick and tired of my current life, and I knew I couldn't 
                keep going the way I was. Something had to give. That realisation threw me headfirst 
                into learning, and I haven't looked back since.

            <h3 class="content-title">What I'm Learning</h3>
            <p class="content-para">
                My main focus has been <strong>front-end development</strong>, diving deep into the world of HTML, CSS, a
                nd JavaScript. However, my curiosity doesn't stop there. In my spare time, I explore other areas of 
                coding—not necessarily in a structured way, but more out of interest, to see what's out there and what excites me.
            </p>
            <h3 class="content-title">Challenges & Overcoming Them</h3>
            <p class="content-para">
                Like any journey, this hasn't been smooth sailing. Motivation has been a struggle at times, especially 
                when life throws curveballs. It's hard to push forward when things feel tough, but I've learned that 
                because I'm passionate about what I'm doing, those dips in motivation never last too long.
                <br>
                <br>
                I've found ways to overcome these obstacles—talking to friends and family, researching better mental 
                health practices, and actively working on my mindset. Learning isn't just about coding for me; it's about 
                growing as a person and developing habits that keep me moving forward.
            </p>
            <h3 class="content-title">Milestones & Achievements</h3>
            <p class="content-para">
                One of my biggest achievements so far has been completing the Essential JavaScript Course. 
                This was a huge moment for me—it felt like the first time I had truly learned and applied a "proper" 
                programming language. That feeling of accomplishment was a massive confidence boost, proving to myself that I can do this.
            </p>
            <h3 class="content-title">How This Journey Has Changed Me</h3>
            <p class="content-para">
                Beyond technical skills, this journey has unlocked my creativity. I now look forward to challenges instead of 
                dreading them, and for the first time in a while, I'm genuinely excited about what the future might hold.
            </p>
            <h3 class="content-title">What's Next?</h3>
            <p class="content-para">
                My ultimate goal is to <strong>become a front-end developer</strong>. Beyond that… who knows? The possibilities are endless, 
                and thats part of what makes this journey so exciting.
            </p>
            <h3 class="content-title">Advice for Others</h3>
            <p class="content-para">
                If there's one thing I've learned, it's this: 
                <strong>it's okay to stumble, trip, and even fall. What's not okay is staying down</strong>. 
                You don't have to get back up immediately—though it's easier if you do—but you must get up. 
                Keep pushing forward, even when it's hard, because every step you take brings you closer to the future you want.

                    <p class="blog-text text-multi-line">Responsive design is all about making websites look and work great on any screen size. Whether someone is on a phone, 
                        tablet, or desktop, I want my sites to feel seamless. Learning responsive techniques helped me stop designing for 
                        just one layout—and start designing for real people using real devices.</p>

                    <p class="blog-text text-multi-line">JavaScript is what brings websites to life. It's the difference between a static page and an interactive experience. 
                        When I first started learning it, it felt overwhelming—but breaking it down into key concepts helped me build a strong 
                        foundation.</p>

                    <p class="blog-text text-multi-line">CSS is what brings structure and design together. It’s not just about making things look good—it’s about 
                        creating layouts that adapt, interact, and behave the way users expect. As I developed more complex sites, 
                        I realised that understanding the core concepts of CSS was key to building reliable, responsive, and 
                        maintainable designs.</p>
