            <p class="intro-para">
                CSS is what brings structure and design together. It’s not just about making things look good—it’s about 
                creating layouts that adapt, interact, and behave the way users expect. As I developed more complex sites, 
                I realised that understanding the core concepts of CSS was key to building reliable, responsive, and 
                maintainable designs.

            <h3 class="content-title">What I Learned About CSS</h3>
            <p class="content-para">
                CSS has a learning curve that flattens out once you get the essentials. Here are the concepts that helped me the most:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Box Model</strong> – Every element is a box. Understanding margin, border, padding, and content helped me fix layout issues faster.</li>
                <li><strong>Display Types</strong> – Knowing when to use block, inline, flex, or grid gave me more control over structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Positioning</strong> – static, relative, absolute, and fixed used to confuse me. Now I use them with purpose.</li>
                <li><strong>Specificity & Inheritance</strong> – CSS conflicts often come down to understanding which rule “wins.” Learning how selectors are weighed changed everything.</li>
                <li><strong>Media Queries</strong> – These unlocked responsive design for me. They let me design for all screen sizes, starting mobile-first.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3 class="content-title">Putting CSS Into Practice</h3>
            <p class="content-para">
                As I applied these concepts, I began to write cleaner and more maintainable stylesheets. Some key habits I developed include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Using Utility Classes</strong> – I started creating small reusable classes for margins, padding, and layout tweaks.</li>
                <li><strong>Organising My Styles</strong> – Separating base styles, layout rules, and component-specific CSS helped me stay organised.</li>
                <li><strong>Using Relative Units</strong> – Switching from pixels to rem, em, and % made my designs more adaptable.</li>
                <li><strong>Leveraging Flexbox & Grid</strong> – These two layout systems solved problems I used to hack around with floats and margins.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3 class="content-title">Why It Matters</h3>
            <p class="content-para">
                Learning CSS properly meant I could finally make websites that didn’t break when the screen size changed or a new element was added. 
                Understanding these concepts improved:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Responsiveness</strong> – Layouts adjust cleanly across devices without weird overlaps or broken sections.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability</strong> – My stylesheets are easier to grow and maintain as projects get bigger.</li>
                <li><strong>Confidence</strong> – I now feel comfortable experimenting with new layouts and features.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3 class="content-title">Next Steps</h3>
            <p class="content-para">
                Now that I have the foundations of CSS down, I’m planning to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Deepen my knowledge of <strong>CSS Grid</strong> and advanced layout techniques.</li>
                <li>Explore <strong>custom properties (CSS variables)</strong> to make themes and colour schemes easier to manage.</li>
                <li>Learn about <strong>modern CSS features</strong> like :has(), container queries, and animation performance best practices.</li>
            </ul>

                    <p class="blog-text text-multi-line">Responsive design is all about making websites look and work great on any screen size. Whether someone is on a phone, 
                        tablet, or desktop, I want my sites to feel seamless. Learning responsive techniques helped me stop designing for 
                        just one layout—and start designing for real people using real devices.</p>
