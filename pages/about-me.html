                My name is Freddie and I am 25 years old, living in the United Kingdom.
                I have always loved learning. I've created this site in order to document
                my learning process with software engineering and to demonstrate the skills
                I have learned so far.

            <h3 class="content-title">Why I'm Learning Software Engineering</h3>
            <p class="content-para">
                A lot of things led me to start learning software engineering. 
                I'd be lying if I said the lifestyle often depicted on social media didn't catch my 
                attention  — flexible hours, financial freedom, the ability to work from anywhere. While 
                I know that social media can embellish reality, there's still something inspiring about 
                the idea of building a career that isn't tied to one location or a rigid schedule.
                <br>
                <br>
                But beyond that, what truly excites me is the ability to create something from nothing. 
                The idea that a few lines of code—written in a language I'm still learning—can become a 
                full app, website, or even a game? That's incredible to me. It's like having a superpower, 
                and I want to master it.
            </p>
            <h3 class="content-title">The Thrill of Problem-Solving</h3>
            <p class="content-para">
                What excites me most about software engineering is problem-solving. There's nothing quite 
                like that moment when you finally figure out a problem that's been bugging you for hours. 
                Or when you discover a new, more efficient way to do something. Coding is essentially a 
                constant puzzle, and I love the challenge of piecing things together in a way that makes sense.
            </p>
            <h3 class="content-title">Overcoming Self-Doubt</h3>
            <p class="content-para">
                Of course, learning software engineering isn't without its challenges. But to be honest, most of 
                the struggles I've faced so far have been self-imposed. Imposter syndrome is a big one—there are 
                days when I question whether I'm actually learning or just going through the motions. Am I solving 
                problems, or am I just following solutions?
                <br>
                <br>
                Getting out of that headspace is tough. But I remind myself that learning is a process, and it's okay 
                to Google answers or ask for help. Nobody becomes an expert overnight, and every experienced developer 
                once felt the same way I do now.
            </p>
            <h3 class="content-title">My Goals and Where I'm Headed</h3>
            <p class="content-para">
                Right now, my main goal is to become a front-end developer. I'm not even in the tech industry yet, so 
                getting that first job will be a huge milestone. Eventually, I'd love to become a full-stack engineer, 
                but I'm taking things one step at a time.
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm not sure whether I'll go down the corporate route or try my hand at startups, but for now, the focus 
                is on getting my foot in the door and building up my skills.
            </p>
            <h3 class="content-title">How I'm Learning</h3>
            <p class="content-para">
                My learning approach is a mix of structured courses and self-study. Scrimba has been a fantastic resource — 
                having someone talk through concepts instead of just presenting an answer has helped me grasp things better. 
                At the same time, self-study lets me tackle real-world problems on my own, which has been just as valuable.
                <br>
                <br>
                This journey is just beginning, but I'm excited to see where it takes me. If nothing else, learning to code 
                has already shown me how much I enjoy solving problems and creating things from scratch. And that's enough 
                motivation to keep going.

                    <p class="blog-text text-multi-line">CSS is what brings structure and design together. It’s not just about making things look good—it’s about 
                        creating layouts that adapt, interact, and behave the way users expect. As I developed more complex sites, 
                        I realised that understanding the core concepts of CSS was key to building reliable, responsive, and 
                        maintainable designs.</p>
