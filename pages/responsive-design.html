                Responsive design is all about making websites look and work great on any screen size. Whether someone is on a phone, 
                tablet, or desktop, I want my sites to feel seamless. Learning responsive techniques helped me stop designing for 
                just one layout—and start designing for real people using real devices.

            <h3 class="content-title">What I Learned About Responsive Design</h3>
            <p class="content-para">
                At first, I thought responsiveness was just about shrinking things—but it's much more than that. Some key concepts I learned:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mobile-First Design</strong> – I started by designing for smaller screens and built up from there.</li>
                <li><strong>Fluid Layouts</strong> – Using relative units like %, em, and rem helped my content scale naturally.</li>
                <li><strong>Media Queries</strong> – I used these to apply different styles at different screen sizes, improving layout and readability.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexbox & Grid</strong> – These layout systems made it easier to build responsive, flexible structures.</li>
                <li><strong>Responsive Images</strong> – Using max-width: 100% and object-fit helped my visuals scale correctly.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3 class="content-title">Putting Responsive Design Into Practice</h3>
            <p class="content-para">
                I’ve started using these principles in all my projects. Some changes I made include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Using media queries</strong> – To change font sizes, layout directions, and padding at breakpoints like 600px and 900px.</li>
                <li><strong>Testing on real devices</strong> – I now check my sites on mobile phones and tablets to catch issues early.</li>
                <li><strong>Building flexible containers</strong> – I rely on flexbox and grid to handle layout changes smoothly.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3 class="content-title">Why It Matters</h3>
            <p class="content-para">
                Responsive design isn't optional anymore—it's essential. These skills help me:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reach more users</strong> – Since most people browse on phones, mobile-friendly design is critical.</li>
                <li><strong>Improve usability</strong> – Responsive layouts reduce friction and frustration.</li>
                <li><strong>Build future-proof websites</strong> – My projects are ready for a wide variety of screens and devices.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3 class="content-title">Next Steps</h3>
            <p class="content-para">
                My next goals for improving responsive design include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Learning <strong>container queries</strong> for even more layout flexibility.</li>
                <li>Mastering <strong>responsive typography</strong> using the clamp() function.</li>
                <li>Exploring <strong>accessibility in responsive contexts</strong> to ensure my designs stay usable at all sizes.</li>
            </ul>

                    <p class="blog-text text-multi-line">CSS is what brings structure and design together. It’s not just about making things look good—it’s about 
                        creating layouts that adapt, interact, and behave the way users expect. As I developed more complex sites, 
                        I realised that understanding the core concepts of CSS was key to building reliable, responsive, and 
                        maintainable designs.</p>
