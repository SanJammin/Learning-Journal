                My journey into web development started with HTML and CSS, the fundamental tools for building and styling web pages. 
                I learned how to structure content using HTML elements and bring designs to life with CSS, experimenting with layouts, 
                colours, typography, and spacing. Understanding these basics gave me the ability to create visually appealing and functional 
                web pages while setting a strong foundation for more advanced concepts like responsive design and interactivity. 
                This stage of learning was all about getting comfortable with the core principles, and now, with these essential skills, 
                I feel ready to take on more complex challenges in front-end development.

            <h3 class="content-title">Understanding HTML: The Structure of the Web</h3>
            <p class="content-para">
                HTML is the backbone of any webpage. It provides the basic structure using elements such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Headings (&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;)</strong> - Define section titles and page hierarchy.</li>
                <li><strong>Paragraphs (&lt;p&gt;)</strong> - Organise text content.</li>
                <li><strong>Links (&lt;a&gt;)</strong> - Connect pages and external resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Images (&lt;img&gt;)</strong> - Add visuals to enhance content.</li>
                <li><strong>Lists (&lt;ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt;)</strong> - Structure items in bullet points or numbered sequences.</li>
                <li><strong>Divs and Spans (&lt;div&gt;, &lt;span&gt;)</strong> - Group and style content.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="content-title">CSS: Bringing Web Pages to Life</h3>
            <p class="content-para">
                Once the structure is in place, <strong>CSS</strong> is used to control the appearance of a webpage. 
                Some of the key CSS concepts I learned include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Selectors</strong> - Targeting elements (class, id, element selectors).</li>
                <li><strong>Colours & Typography</strong> - Customising text, fonts, and background colours.</li>
                <li><strong>Box Model</strong> - Understanding how margins, borders, padding, and content interact.</li>
                <li><strong>Positioning & Layouts</strong> - Using flexbox and grid to arrange elements.</li>
                <li><strong>Responsive Design</strong> - Making layouts adapt to different screen sizes using media queries.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="content-title">Building My First Layouts</h3>
            <p class="content-para">
                After learning the basics, I put my knowledge into practice by creating simple webpage layouts. This involved:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Structuring the page with <strong>semantic HTML elements</strong> (&lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;).</li>
                <li>Using <strong>CSS flexbox and grid</strong> to create responsive layouts.</li>
                <li>Experimenting with <strong>colours, spacing, and typography</strong> to style content.</li>
                <li>Ensuring the design looked good on different screen sizes with <strong>media queries</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="content-title">Next Steps</h3>
            <p class="content-para">
                Learning the basics of HTML and CSS was an important first step, but there's still so much more to explore. 
                Next, I'll be diving deeper into:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> to add interactivity.</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced CSS techniques</strong> like animations and transitions.</li>
                <li><strong>Responsive and accessible design principles</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="content-para">
                With each step, I'm getting closer to becoming a skilled front-end developer, ready to take on more complex projects.

                    <p class="blog-text text-multi-line">Responsive design is all about making websites look and work great on any screen size. Whether someone is on a phone, 
                        tablet, or desktop, I want my sites to feel seamless. Learning responsive techniques helped me stop designing for 
                        just one layout—and start designing for real people using real devices.</p>

                    <p class="blog-text text-multi-line">CSS is what brings structure and design together. It’s not just about making things look good—it’s about 
                        creating layouts that adapt, interact, and behave the way users expect. As I developed more complex sites, 
                        I realised that understanding the core concepts of CSS was key to building reliable, responsive, and 
                        maintainable designs.</p>
