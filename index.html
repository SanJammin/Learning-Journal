                There comes a point when you realise that something has to change. For me, that 
                moment hit hard—I was sick and tired of my current life, and I knew I couldn't 
                keep going the way I was. Something had to give. That realisation threw me headfirst 
                into learning, and I haven't looked back since.

                        My journey into web development started with HTML and CSS, the fundamental tools for building and styling web pages. 
                        I learned how to structure content using HTML elements and bring designs to life with CSS, experimenting with layouts, 
                        colours, typography, and spacing. Understanding these basics gave me the ability to create visually appealing and functional 
                        web pages while setting a strong foundation for more advanced concepts like responsive design and interactivity. 
                        This stage of learning was all about getting comfortable with the core principles, and now, with these essential skills, 
                        I feel ready to take on more complex challenges in front-end development.

                    <p class="blog-text text-multi-line">
                        After learning the basics of HTML and CSS, I took the next step by introducing JavaScript 
                        to add interactivity to my web pages. While HTML structures the content and CSS styles it, 
                        JavaScript makes things dynamic—allowing elements to respond to user actions, update in real-time, 
                        and create a more engaging experience. This was my first dive into programming logic within web 
                        development, and even with just the basics, I was able to make my websites feel more interactive and alive.

                        Building a website isn't just about making it look good—it's about ensuring that everyone can 
                        use it, regardless of their abilities or circumstances. As I continued my journey in web development, 
                        I learned how to create websites that are accessible to a wide range of users, including those with 
                        visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments.

                    <p class="blog-text text-multi-line">CSS is what brings structure and design together. It’s not just about making things look good—it’s about 
                        creating layouts that adapt, interact, and behave the way users expect. As I developed more complex sites, 
                        I realised that understanding the core concepts of CSS was key to building reliable, responsive, and 
                        maintainable designs.</p>

                    <p class="blog-text text-multi-line">JavaScript is what brings websites to life. It's the difference between a static page and an interactive experience. 
                        When I first started learning it, it felt overwhelming—but breaking it down into key concepts helped me build a strong 
                        foundation.</p>

                    <p class="blog-text text-multi-line">Responsive design is all about making websites look and work great on any screen size. Whether someone is on a phone, 
                        tablet, or desktop, I want my sites to feel seamless. Learning responsive techniques helped me stop designing for 
                        just one layout—and start designing for real people using real devices.</p>
